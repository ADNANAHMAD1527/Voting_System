# Voting System in C++

This project showcases a simple yet functional voting system built in C++. Users can vote for BJP, Congress, CPM, AAP, or NOTA. The program meticulously counts votes, displays real-time results, and identifies the leading party.

Voting Process
Users vote by entering a number corresponding to their chosen party. The program dynamically shows the party with the most votes, keeping users informed about the current standings.

Features
Additionally, there is a user-friendly exit option, allowing users to exit the voting process at any point. This project leverages basic C++ constructs, such as loops, conditionals, and switch cases, to create an efficient voting system, demonstrating effective handling of user input and data processing.
